# PythonProjects

This is a collection of small programs written in Python. I am still actively working on them and will add to them continuously as I play and experiment with different things.
I am currently working on a Quiz Game. It uses tk to draw the GUI and is a time-based time testing your knowledge with random trivia questions! 

It is my playground for experimenting with python. You can find many under the folder named Greetings.
